\ Materials science is based on multi-scale and multi-physical disciplines (scientific discipline); therefore, in this field, there are many types of data, models, and terms with various meanings, making it difficult to operate data on unified discipline (data discipline).

\ However, a well-defined uni-language that treats multimodal forms can help operations.

\ Therefore, we are developing a language, named "tq", that can parse tree or graph structures, enabling the operation of several data formats, models and dictionaries for materials science.
